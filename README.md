# Dad Joke Generator

Inspired by my personal love for horrible dad jokes and my current fixation on AntD - mostly I just wanted to build something silly and do some design work with AntD!

Using the https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ API to fetch the jokes.

Thanks for checking it out! I really do appreciate your support!

Please note: I am slowly working on making the Navigation Bar look better after I decided to add a few more Joke Generators into the program. I'm planning on making sure it all looks nice soon! This is a small, fun project that I am working on between work.
